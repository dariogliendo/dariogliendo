# Hello!

I am Darío Liendo, a software developer from Córdoba, Argentina. I'm currently working as a fullstack developer at Woxi and eager to keep learning!

I am lately making efforts to become a more active contributor to the Open Source community and learning more and more.

My next goal is to keep learning Unity until I can get some of my code into a real videogame project, so hit me up if you need some beginner assistance!
